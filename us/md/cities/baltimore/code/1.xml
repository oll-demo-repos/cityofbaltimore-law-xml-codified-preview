        <text>The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore finds and declares that the threat, fear, and intimidation caused by the criminal element is one of the most compelling problems facing society today.  Crime isolates people in their own homes, causing them to become suspicious of, and in some cases afraid of, their neighbors.  And yet, law enforcement officials tell us that neighborhoods with little inter-residential communication are more vulnerable to crime than are those in which neighbors communicate and cooperate with each other on a regular basis.</text>
